# Fake News Detection Using NLP

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a Fake News Detection project using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The aim of this project is to build a system that can automatically identify and classify fake news articles from real ones. Fake news is a growing concern in today's digital age, and this project addresses the need for automated tools to help users differentiate between reliable and unreliable news sources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can get started with this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Required libraries and dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data

This project uses a dataset of news articles, consisting of both real and fake news samples. The dataset can be obtained from [source link](insert link). After downloading the dataset, make sure to place it in the `data` directory of this project.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
fake-news-detection/
│
├── data/
│   ├── fake_news.csv
│   ├── real_news.csv
│
├── models/
│   ├── trained_model.pkl
│
├── notebooks/
│
├── src/
│   ├── data_processing.py
│   ├── model.py
│   ├── main.py
│
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
```

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset, with fake and real news articles in separate CSV files.

- `models/`: This directory is used to save trained machine learning models.

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis.

- `src/`: This directory contains the Python source code for data processing, model training, and prediction.

## Usage

To use the fake news detection system:

1. Ensure that you have the required dataset in the `data/` directory.

2. Open the `main.py` file and configure any necessary settings, such as model hyperparameters.

3. Run the `main.py` script to classify news articles as fake or real.

## Model Training

If you want to retrain the model, you can use the provided data and follow these steps:

1. Run the `data_processing.py` script to preprocess and prepare the data.

2. Modify the model architecture and hyperparameters in the `model.py` script.

3. Execute the training process by running the `main.py` script.

4. The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory.

## Evaluation

You can evaluate the model's performance by running the `main.py` script with the evaluation mode enabled. This will provide metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
